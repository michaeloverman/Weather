My version of the Weather app built in Udacity Android course. Based on their version of Sunshine.
I am trying to do all the coding myself - that is, not just taking their code and reading it. But I started with the very first branch of their code. Thus their README below.


Sunshine
========

Sunshine is the companion Android app for the Udacity course [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853).

Take the course to find out how to build this app a step at a time, and eventually create your own Android App!

This is the second version of the Sunshine code. The repository has been updated on:

* **February 13th, 2015** - Major update
* February 25, 2015 - Minor bug fixes
* March 4th, 2015 - Minor bug fixes

For the original version, please go [here](https://github.com/udacity/Sunshine).

A changelog for the course can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/a/knowlabs.com/document/d/193xJb_OpcNCqgquMhxPrMh05IEYFXQqt0S6-6YK8gBw/pub).
